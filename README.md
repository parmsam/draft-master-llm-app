# draft-master-llm-app

This Shiny for Python app is inspired by the Copilot email drafting feature for Outlook from Microsoft. It helps you draft an email or text message with some help from the OpenAI API. Not all email client or text message apps have an AI assistant like Copilot enabled, so this app can help you in those cases.

## Setup

The app expects that you have an OpenAI API key that you can paste into the input box. You can get one by visting the OpenAI API [quickstart page](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart/).

## Accessing the app

You can clone this repo and run the app locally or access the app via [Connect Cloud](https://connect.posit.cloud/) at the website link in the repository details (under "About"). You may need to create a Connect Cloud account to access the app.
